# **Definition**

Consider any pipeline that ingests data and outputs results continuously. We

wish to solve the general problem of when it is safe to call an event-time

window closed, meaning that the window does not expect any more data. To

do so we would like to characterize the progress that the pipeline is making

relative to its unbounded input.

One naive approach for solving the event-time windowing problem would be

to simply base our event-time windows on the current processing time. As we

saw in Chapter 1, we quickly run into trouble—data processing and transport

is not instantaneous, so processing and event times are almost never equal.

Any hiccup or spike in our pipeline might cause us to incorrectly assign

messages to windows. Ultimately, this strategy fails because we have no

robust way to make any guarantees about such windows.

Another intuitive, but ultimately incorrect, approach would be to consider the

rate of messages processed by the pipeline. Although this is an interesting

metric, the rate may vary arbitrarily with changes in input, variability of

expected results, resources available for processing, and so on. Even more

important, rate does not help answer the fundamental questions of

completeness. Specifically, rate does not tell us when we have seen all of the

messages for a particular time interval. In a real-world system, there will be

situations in which messages are not making progress through the system.

This could be the result of transient errors (such as crashes, network failures,

machine downtime), or the result of persistent errors such as application-level

failures that require changes to the application logic or other manual

intervention to resolve. Of course, if lots of failures are occurring, a rate-of

processing metric might be a good proxy for detecting this. However a rate

metric could never tell us that a single message is failing to make progress

through our pipeline. Even a single such message, however, can arbitrarily

affect the correctness of the output results.

We require a more robust measure of progress. To arrive there, we make one

fundamental assumption about our streaming data: *each message has an*

*associated logical event timestamp*. This assumption is reasonable in the

context of continuously arriving unbounded data because this implies the

continuous generation of input data. In most cases, we can take the time of the

original event’s occurrence as its logical event timestamp. With all input

messages containing an event timestamp, we can then examine the

distribution of such timestamps in any pipeline. Such a pipeline might be

distributed to process in parallel over many agents and consuming input

messages with no guarantee of ordering between individual shards. Thus, the

set of event timestamps for active in-flight messages in this pipeline will form

a distribution, as illustrated in Figure 3-1.

Messages are ingested by the pipeline, processed, and eventually marked

completed. Each message is either “in-flight,” meaning that it has been

received but not yet completed, or “completed,” meaning that no more

processing on behalf of this message is required. If we examine the

distribution of messages by event time, it will look something like Figure 3-1.

As time advances, more messages will be added to the “in-flight” distribution

on the right, and more of those messages from the “in-flight” part of the

distribution will be completed and moved into the “completed” distribution.

*Figure 3-1. Distribution of in-flight and completed message event times within a streaming pipeline.*

*New messages arrive as input and remain “in-flight” until processing for them completes. The leftmost*

*edge of the “in-flight” distribution corresponds to the oldest unprocessed element at any given moment.*

There is a key point on this distribution, located at the leftmost edge of the

“in-flight” distribution, corresponding to the oldest event timestamp of any

unprocessed message of our pipeline. We use this value to define the

watermark:

*The watermark is a monotonically increasing timestamp of the oldest work*

*not yet completed.*

There are two fundamental properties that are provided by this definition that

make it useful:

- Completeness

If the watermark has advanced past some timestamp *T*, we are guaranteed

by its monotonic property that no more processing will occur for on-time

(nonlate data) events at or before *T*. Therefore, we can correctly emit any

aggregations at or before *T*. In other words, the watermark allows us to

know when it is correct to close a window.

- Visibility

If a message is stuck in our pipeline for any reason, the watermark cannot

advance. Furthermore, we will be able to find the source of the problem

by examining the message that is preventing the watermark from

advancing.

# **Source Watermark Creation**

Where do these watermarks come from? To establish a watermark for a data

source, we must assign a logical event timestamp to every message entering

the pipeline from that source. As Chapter 2 informs us, all watermark creation

falls into one of two broad categories: *perfect* or *heuristic*. To remind

ourselves about the difference between perfect and heuristic watermarks, let’s

look at Figure 3-2, which presents the windowed summation example from

Chapter 2.

*Figure 3-2. Windowed summation with perfect (left) and heuristic (right) watermarks*

Notice that the distinguishing feature is that perfect watermarks ensure that

the watermark accounts for *all* data, whereas heuristic watermarks admit

some late-data elements.

After the watermark is created as either perfect or heuristic, watermarks

remain so throughout the rest of the pipeline. As to what makes watermark

creation perfect or heuristic, it depends a great deal on the nature of the source

that’s being consumed. To see why, let’s look at a few examples of each type

of watermark creation.

### **Perfect Watermark Creation**

Perfect watermark creation assigns timestamps to incoming messages in such

a way that the resulting watermark is a *strict guarantee* that no data with

event times less than the watermark will ever be seen again from this source.

Pipelines using perfect watermark creation never have to deal with late data;

that is, data that arrive after the watermark has advanced past the event times

of newly arriving messages. However, perfect watermark creation requires

perfect knowledge of the input, and thus is impractical for many real-world

distributed input sources. Here are a couple of examples of use cases that can

create perfect watermarks:

- Ingress timestamping

A source that assigns ingress times as the event times for data entering the

system can create a perfect watermark. In this case, the source watermark

simply tracks the current processing time as observed by the pipeline.

This is essentially the method that nearly all streaming systems supporting

windowing prior to 2016 used.

Because event times are assigned from a single, monotonically increasing

source (actual processing time), the system thus has perfect knowledge

about which timestamps will come next in the stream of data. As a result,

event-time progress and windowing semantics become vastly easier to

reason about. The downside, of course, is that the watermark has no

correlation to the event times of the data themselves; those event times

were effectively discarded, and the watermark instead merely tracks the

progress of data relative to its arrival in the system.

- Static sets of time-ordered logs

A statically sized input source of time-ordered logs (e.g., an Apache

Kafka topic with a static set of partitions, where each partition of the

source contains monotonically increasing event times) would be relatively

straightforward source atop which to create a perfect watermark. To do so,

the source would simply track the minimum event time of unprocessed

data across the known and static set of source partitions (i.e., the

minimum of the event times of the most recently read record in each of

the partitions).

Similar to the aforementioned ingress timestamps, the system has perfect

knowledge about which timestamps will come next, thanks to the fact that

event times across the static set of partitions are known to increase

monotonically. This is effectively a form of bounded out-of-order

processing; the amount of disorder across the known set of partitions is

bounded by the minimum observed event time among those partitions.

Typically, the only way you can guarantee monotonically increasing

timestamps within partitions is if the timestamps within those partitions

are assigned as data are written to it; for example, by web frontends

logging events directly into Kafka. Though still a limited use case, this is

definitely a much more useful one than ingress timestamping upon arrival

at the data processing system because the watermark tracks meaningful

event times of the underlying data.

### **Heuristic Watermark Creation**

Heuristic watermark creation, on the other hand, creates a watermark that is

merely an *estimate* that no data with event times less than the watermark will

ever be seen again. Pipelines using heuristic watermark creation might need

to deal with some amount of *late data*. Late data is any data that arrives after

the watermark has advanced past the event time of this data. Late data is only

possible with heuristic watermark creation. If the heuristic is a reasonably

good one, the amount of late data might be very small, and the watermark

remains useful as a completion estimate. The system still needs to provide a

way for the user to cope with late data if it’s to support use cases requiring

correctness (e.g., things like billing).

For many real-world, distributed input sources, it’s computationally or

operationally impractical to construct a perfect watermark, but still possible to

build a highly accurate heuristic watermark by taking advantage of structural

features of the input data source. Following are two example for which

heuristic watermarks (of varying quality) are possible:

- Dynamic sets of time-ordered logs

Consider a dynamic set of structured log files (each individual file

containing records with monotonically increasing event times relative to

other records in the same file but with no fixed relationship of event times

between files), where the full set of expected log files (i.e., partitions, in

Kafka parlance) is not known at runtime. Such inputs are often found in

global-scale services constructed and managed by a number of

independent teams. In such a use case, creating a perfect watermark over

the input is intractable, but creating an accurate heuristic watermark is

quite possible.

By tracking the minimum event times of unprocessed data in the existing

set of log files, monitoring growth rates, and utilizing external information

like network topology and bandwidth availability, you can create a

remarkably accurate watermark, even given the lack of perfect knowledge

of all the inputs. This type of input source is one of the most common

types of unbounded datasets found at Google, so we have extensive

experience with creating and analyzing watermark quality for such

scenarios and have seen them used to good effect across a number of use

cases.

- Google Cloud Pub/Sub

Cloud Pub/Sub is an interesting use case. Pub/Sub currently makes no

guarantees on in-order delivery; even if a single publisher publishes two

messages in order, there’s a chance (usually small) that they might be

delivered out of order (this is due to the dynamic nature of the underlying

architecture, which allows for transparent scaling up to very high levels of

throughput with zero user intervention). As a result, there’s no way to

guarantee a perfect watermark for Cloud Pub/Sub. The Cloud Dataflow

team has, however, built a reasonably accurate heuristic watermark by

taking advantage of what knowledge *is* available about the data in Cloud

Pub/Sub. The implementation of this heuristic is discussed at length as a

case study later in this chapter.

Consider an example where users play a mobile game, and their scores are

sent to our pipeline for processing: you can generally assume that for any

source utilizing mobile devices for input it will be generally impossible to

provide a perfect watermark. Due to the problem of devices that go offline for

extended periods of time, there’s just no way to provide any sort of

reasonable estimate of absolute completeness for such a data source. You can,

however, imagine building a watermark that accurately tracks input

completeness for devices that are currently online, similar to the Google

Pub/Sub watermark described a moment ago. Users who are actively online

are likely the most relevant subset of users from the perspective of providing

low-latency results anyway, so this often isn’t as much of a shortcoming as

you might initially think.

With heuristic watermark creation, broadly speaking, the more that is known

about the source, the better the heuristic, and the fewer late data items will be

seen. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, given that the types of sources,

distributions of events, and usage patterns will vary greatly. But in either case

(perfect or heuristic), after a watermark is created at the input source, the

system can propagate the watermark through the pipeline perfectly. This

means perfect watermarks will remain perfect downstream, and heuristic

watermarks will remain strictly as heuristic as they were when established.

This is the benefit of the watermark approach: you can reduce the complexity

of tracking completeness in a pipeline entirely to the problem of creating a

watermark at the source.

# **Watermark Propagation**

So far, we have considered only the watermark for the inputs within the

context of a single operation or stage. However, most real-world pipelines

consist of multiple stages. Understanding how watermarks propagate across

independent stages is important in understanding how they affect the pipeline

as a whole and the observed latency of its results.

**PIPELINE STAGES**

Different stages are typically necessary every time your pipeline groups

data together by some new dimension. For example, if you had a pipeline

that consumed raw data, computed some per-user aggregates, and then

used those per-user aggregates to compute some per-team aggregates,

you’d likely end up with a three-stage pipeline:

One consuming the raw, ungrouped data

One grouping the data by user and computing per-user aggregates

One grouping the data by team and computing per-team

aggregates

We learn more about the effects of grouping on pipeline shapes in

Chapter 6.

Watermarks are created at input sources, as discussed in the preceding

section. They then conceptually flow through the system as data progress

through it. You can track watermarks at varying levels of granularity. For

pipelines comprising multiple distinct stages, each stage likely tracks its own

watermark, whose value is a function of all the inputs and stages that come

before it. Therefore, stages that come later in the pipeline will have

watermarks that are further in the past (because they’ve seen less of the

overall input).

We can define watermarks at the boundaries of any single operation, or stage,

in the pipeline. This is useful not only in understanding the relative progress

that each stage in the pipeline is making, but for dispatching timely results

independently and as soon as possible for each individual stage. We give the

following definitions for the watermarks at the boundaries of stages:

- An *input watermark*, which captures the progress of everything

upstream of that stage (i.e., how complete the input is for that stage).

For sources, the input watermark is a source-specific function

creating the watermark for the input data. For nonsource stages, the

input watermark is defined as the minimum of the output watermarks

of all shards/partitions/instances of all of its upstream sources and

stages.

- An *output watermark*, which captures the progress of the stage itself,

and is essentially defined as the minimum of the stage’s input

watermark and the event times of all nonlate data active messages

within the stage. Exactly what “active” encompasses is somewhat

dependent upon the operations a given stage actually performs, and

the implementation of the stream processing system. It typically

includes data buffered for aggregation but not yet materialized

downstream, pending output data in flight to downstream stages, and

so on.

One nice feature of defining an input and output watermark for a specific

stage is that we can use these to calculate the amount of event-time latency

introduced by a stage. Subtracting the value of a stage’s output watermark

from the value of its input watermark gives the amount of event-time latency

or *lag* introduced by the stage. This lag is the notion of how far delayed

behind real time the output of each stage will be. As an example, a stage

performing 10-second windowed aggregations will have a lag of 10 seconds

or more, meaning that the output of the stage will be at least that much

delayed behind the input and real time. Definitions of input and output

watermarks provide a recursive relationship of watermarks throughout a

pipeline. Each subsequent stage in a pipeline delays the watermark as

necessary, based on event-time lag of the stage.

Processing within each stage is also not monolithic. We can segment the

processing within one stage into a flow with several conceptual components,

each of which contributes to the output watermark. As mentioned previously,

the exact nature of these components depends on the operations the stage

performs and the implementation of the system. Conceptually, each such

component serves as a buffer where active messages can reside until some

operation has completed. For example, as data arrives, it is buffered for

processing. Processing might then write the data to state for later delayed

aggregation. Delayed aggregation, when triggered, might write the results to

an output buffer awaiting consumption from a downstream stage, as shown in

Figure 3-3.

*Figure 3-3. Example system components of a streaming system stage, containing buffers of in-flight*

*data. Each will have associated watermark tracking, and the overall output watermark of the stage will be the minimum of the watermarks across all such buffers.*

We can track each such buffer with its own watermark. The minimum of the

watermarks across the buffers of each stage forms the output watermark of

the stage. Thus the output watermark could be the minimum of the following:

- *Per-source* watermark—for each sending stage.
- *Per-external input* watermark—for sources external to the pipeline
- *Per-state component* watermark—for each type of state that can be

written

- *Per-output buffer* watermark—for each receiving stage

Making watermarks available at this level of granularity also provides better

visibility into the behavior of the system. The watermarks track locations of

messages across various buffers in the system, allowing for easier diagnosis

of stuckness.





### **Understanding Watermark Propagation**

To get a better sense for the relationship between input and output

watermarks and how they affect watermark propagation, let’s look at an

example. Let’s consider gaming scores, but instead of computing sums of

team scores, we’re going to take a stab at measuring user engagement levels.

We’ll do this by first calculating per-user session lengths, under the

assumption that the amount of time a user stays engaged with the game is a

reasonable proxy for how much they’re enjoying it. After answering our four

questions once to calculate sessions lengths, we’ll then answer them a second

time to calculate average session lengths within fixed periods of time.

To make our example even more interesting, lets say that we are working

with two datasets, one for Mobile Scores and one for Console Scores. We

would like to perform identical score calculations via integer summation in

parallel over these two independant datasets. One pipeline is calculating

scores for users playing on mobile devices, whereas the other is for users

playing on home gaming consoles, perhaps due to different data collection

strategies employed for the different platforms. The important point is that

these two stages are performing the same operation but over different data,

and thus with very different output watermarks.

To begin, let’s take a look at Example 3-1 to see what the abbreviated code

for what the first section of this pipeline might be like.

*Example 3-1. Calculating session lengths*

`PCollection<Double> mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

`PCollection<Double> consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

Here, we read in each of our inputs independently, and whereas previously we

were keying our collections by team, in this example we key by user. After

that, for the first stage of each pipeline, we window into sessions and then call

a custom PTransform named CalculateWindowLength. This PTransform

simply groups by key (i.e., User) and then computes the per-user session

length by treating the size of the current window as the value for that window.

In this case, we’re fine with the default trigger (AtWatermark) and

accumulation mode (discardingFiredPanes) settings, but I’ve listed them

explicitly for completeness. The output for each pipeline for two particular

users might look something like Figure 3-4.

*Figure 3-4. Per-user session lengths across two different input pipelines*

Because we need to track data across multiple stages, we track everything

related to Mobile Scores in red, everything related to Console Scores in blue,

while the watermark and output for Average Session Lengths in Figure 3-5

are yellow.

We have answered the four questions of *what*, *where*, *when*, and *how* to

compute individual session lengths. Next we’ll answer them a second time to

transform those session lengths into global session-length averages within

fixed windows of time. This requires us to first flatten our two data sources

into one, and then re-window into fixed windows; we’ve already captured the

important essence of the session in the session-length value we computed, and

we now want to compute a global average of those sessions within consistent

windows of time over the course of the day. Example 3-2 shows the code for

this.

*Example 3-2. Calculating session lengths*

`PCollection<Double> mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

`PCollection<Double> consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

`PCollection<Float> averageSessionLengths = PCollectionList`

`.of(mobileSessions).and(consoleSessions)`

`.apply(Flatten.pCollections())`

`.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.apply(Mean.globally());`

If we were to see this pipeline in action, it would look something like

Figure 3-5. As before, the two input pipelines are computing individual

session lengths for mobile and console players. Those session lengths then

feed into the second stage of the pipeline, where global session-length

averages are computed in fixed windows.

*Figure 3-5. Average session lengths of mobile and console gaming sessions*

Let’s walk through some of this example, given that there’s a lot going on.

The two important points here are:

- The *output watermark* for each of the Mobile Sessions and Console

Sessions stages is at least as old as the corresponding input

watermark of each, and in reality a little bit older. This is because in

a real system computing answers takes time, and we don’t allow the

output watermark to advance until processing for a given input has

completed.

- The *input watermark* for the Average Session Lengths stage is the

minimum of the output watermarks for the two stages directly

upstream.

The result is that the downstream input watermark is an alias for the minimum

composition of the upstream output watermarks. Note that this matches the

definitions for those two types of watermarks earlier in the chapter. Also

notice how watermarks further downstream are further in the past, capturing

the intuitive notion that upstream stages are going to be further ahead in time

than the stages that follow them.

One observation worth making here is just how cleanly we were able to ask

the questions again in Example 3-1 to substantially alter the results of the

pipeline. Whereas before we simply computed per-user session lengths, we

now compute two-minute global session-length averages. This provides a

much more insightful look into the overall behaviors of the users playing our

games and gives you a tiny glimpse of the difference between simple data

transformations and real data science.

Even better, now that we understand the basics of how this pipeline operates,

we can look more closely at one of the more subtle issues related to asking the

four questions over again: *output timestamps*.





### **Watermark Propagation and Output Timestamps**

In Figure 3-5, I glossed over some of the details of output timestamps. But if

you look closely at the second stage in the diagram, you can see that each of

the outputs from the first stage was assigned a timestamp that matched the

end of its window. Although that’s a fairly natural choice for output

timestamps, it’s not the only valid choice. As you know from earlier in this

chapter, watermarks are never allowed to move backward. Given that

restriction, you can infer that the range of valid timestamps for a given

window begins with the timestamp of the earliest nonlate record in the

window (because only nonlate records are guaranteed to hold a watermark up)

and extends all the way to positive infinity. That’s quite a lot of options. In

practice, however, there tend to be only a few choices that make sense in most

circumstances:

- End of the window

Using the end of the window is the only safe choice if you want the output

timestamp to be representative of the window bounds. As we’ll see in a

moment, it also allows the smoothest watermark progression out of all of

the options.

- Timestamp of first nonlate element

Using the timestamp of the first nonlate element is a good choice when

you want to keep your watermarks as conservative as possible. The trade

off, however, is that watermark progress will likely be more hindered, as

we’ll also see shortly.

- Timestamp of a specific element

For certain use cases, the timestamp of some other arbitrary (from the

system’s perspective) element is the right choice. Imagine a use case in

which you’re joining a stream of queries to a stream of clicks on results

for that query. After performing the join, some systems will find the

timestamp of the query to be more useful; others will prefer the timestamp

of the click. Any such timestamp is valid from a watermark correctness

perspective, as long as it corresponded to an element that did not arrive

late.

Having thought a bit about some alternate options for output timestamps, let’s

look at what effects the choice of output timestamp can have on the overall

pipeline. To make the changes as dramatic as possible, in Example 3-3 and

Figure 3-6, we’ll switch to using the earliest timestamp possible for the

window: the timestamp of the first nonlate element as the timestamp for the

window.

*Example 3-3. Average session lengths pipeline, that output timestamps for*

*session windows set at earliest element*

`PCollection<Double> mobileSessions = IO.read(new MobileInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.withTimestampCombiner(EARLIEST)`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

`PCollection<Double> consoleSessions = IO.read(new ConsoleInputSource())`

`.apply(Window.into(Sessions.withGapDuration(Duration.standardMinutes(1)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.withTimestampCombiner(EARLIEST)`

`.discardingFiredPanes())`

`.apply(CalculateWindowLength());`

`PCollection<Float> averageSessionLengths = PCollectionList`

`.of(mobileSessions).and(consoleSessions)`

`.apply(Flatten.pCollections())`

`.apply(Window.into(FixedWindows.of(Duration.standardMinutes(2)))`

`.triggering(AtWatermark())`

`.apply(Mean.globally());`

*Figure 3-6. Average session lengths for sessions that are output at the timestamp of the earliest element*

To help call out the effect of the output timestamp choice, look at the dashed

lines in the first stages showing what the output watermark for each stage is

being held to. The output watermark is delayed by our choice of timestamp,

as compared to Figures 3-7 and 3-8, in which the output timestamp was

chosen to be the end of the window. You can see from this diagram that the

input watermark of the second stage is thus subsequently also delayed.

*Figure 3-7. Comparison of watermarks and results with different choice of window outout timestamps.*

*The watermarks in this figure correspond to output timestamps at the end of the session windows (i.e.,*

*Figure 3-5).*

*Figure 3-8. In this figure, the watermarks are at the beginning of the session windows (i.e., Figure 3-6).*

*We can see that the watermark line in this figure is more delayed, and the resulting average session*

*lengths are different.*

As far as differences in this version compared to Figure 3-7, two are worth

noting:

- Watermark delay

Compared to Figure 3-5, the watermark proceeds much more slowly in

Figure 3-6. This is because the output watermark for the first stage is held

back to the timestamp of the first element in every window until the input

for that window becomes complete. Only after a given window has been

materialized is the output watermark (and thus the downstream input

watermark) allowed to advance.

- Semantic differences

Because the session timestamps are now assigned to match the earliest

nonlate element in the session, the individual sessions often end up in

different fixed window buckets when we then calculate the session-length

averages in the next stage. There’s nothing inherently right or wrong

about either of the two options we’ve seen so far; they’re just different.

But it’s important to understand that they *will* be different as well as have

an intuition for the way in which they’ll be different so that you can make

the correct choice for your specific use case when the time comes.

### **The Tricky Case of Overlapping Windows**

One additional subtle but important issue regarding output timestamps is how

to handle sliding windows. The naive approach of setting the output

timestamp to the earliest element can very easily lead to delays downstream

due to watermarks being (correctly) held back. To see why, consider an

example pipeline with two stages, each using the same type of sliding

windows. Suppose that each element ends up in three successive windows. As

the input watermark advances, the desired semantics for sliding windows in

this case would be as follows:

- The first window completes in the first stage and is emitted

downstream.

- The first window then completes in the second stage and can also be

emitted downstream.

- Some time later, the second window completes in the first stage…

and so on.

However, if output timestamps are chosen to be the timestamp of the first

nonlate element in the pane, what actually happens is the following:

- The first window completes in the first stage and is emitted

downstream.

- The first window in the second stage remains unable to complete

because its input watermark is being held up by the output

watermark of the second and third windows upstream. Those

watermarks are rightly being held back because the earliest element

timestamp is being used as the output timestamp for those windows.

- The second window completes in the first stage and is emitted

downstream.

- The first and second windows in the second stage remain unable to

complete, held up by the third window upstream.

- The third window completes in the first stage and is emitted

downstream.

- The first, second, and third windows in the second stage are now all

able to complete, finally emitting all three in one swoop.

Although the results of this windowing are correct, this leads to the results

being materialized in an unnecessarily delayed way. Because of this, Beam

has special logic for overlapping windows that ensures the output timestamp

for window *N*+1 is always greater than the end of window *N*.
